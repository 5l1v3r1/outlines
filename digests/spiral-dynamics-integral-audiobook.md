# Digest: Spiral Dynamics Integral

- Author: Don Beck
- Speaker: Don Beck

I had to return this book because the author slowly breaks down until he can no longer perform complete sentences.

## Trent's Summary

I can't say I really disagree with the main thrust of these systems being built on each other like scaffolding.  But I don't see the systems as any of the following

- particularly comprehensive
- a good prognosticative tool
- a way of understanding the past or the future in terms of the present
- or a way to pick apart people or cultures in a way that assists thinking

## Session 1: The Dance of the Double Helix / How Humans Emerge

There are six independent sections that stand on their own but are woven together into a tapestry. Beck is encouraging the reader to listen to the examples and war stories and think within the system.


### Introduction

Beck was reading an article, 'Humans Prepare for a Momentus Leap' in 'The Futurist' - by Clare W. Graves

Here is [the article](http://www.clarewgraves.com/articles_content/1974_Futurist/1974_Futurist.html).

Beck's Summary: 

> The kinds of patterns we detect in our society are not doom and gloom, but an essential stage in human history where we set up the conditions for a major leap into a whole different way of seeing the world.

They became good friends. Beck dedicated his life to making more of Graves' ideas accessible.

During these sessions, Beck will:

> talk about the nature of this powerful conceptual system that from our experiences, in some of the most difficult places on the planet, it may very well hold the key to unlocking many of the conflicts that we find today to be very lethal.

In South Africa, Beck says he used this model "to replace the ethnic-racial categories in Apartheid to make it possible Nelson Mandela for others to move out of the threat of civil war." and now wants to use it on fundamentalist Islamic terrorist mindset in Dutch society and then take it elsewhere. Also redesigning organizations to connect to marketplace and for employees in ways that fit who they are. In sports, the NFL, and global. Also designed schools. "It is beginning to have a universal application." Beck loosely calls it `a theory of everything`, not THE theory of everything.


### Session 1 Overview

We will visit the work of Graves: research, discovery, conceptual system, allay any fears that this is the latest psycho-babble.


### Session 2 Overview

We will take you a trip up the existential staircase, along the psychological map, how each of the numatic codes appeared, why they did, and how they express themselves.  The codes are like musical notes, but form musical chords because they are systems within us, not types of us. 

This session covers the FIRST TIER which is the FIRST SIX SYSTEMS.


### Session 3 Overview

We will move into the `SECOND TIER`, the next set of SIX SYSTEMS and looking at issues today in terms of their complexities and how we can work as individuals, leaders of organizations, communities, and members of the human race. How we can find fresh approaches to the very complex issues that confront us.


### Session 4 Overview

A specific application of this knowledge in terms of change itself.  Change from what, to what.  Look at the EIGHT DIMENSIONS OF CHANGE. Look at particular processes we go through when we leap to a new PLATFORM or PARADIGM. With some precision look at the nature of change in ourselves, life choices, our family relationships, the nature of our communities, and the future of our planet. Look at the whole matter of ORGANIZATIONS.

 
### Session 5 Overview

Begin to look at organizations. Begin to answer the question "How should who manage whom to do what?" or "How should who teach whom to do what?" Moving the focus from the individual trajectory to kinds and domains of human groups. A major part of the approach is how to view, transform, and refresh organizations.


### Session 6 Overview

Take a broad look at 6 billion people and ask "How can we stitch together our wounded world?"


### Anecdotes

Beck talks about Graves feeling unauthentic because he could not address which psychological theories are "useful". Instead of giving up teaching, Graves started a study of thousands of people.  He asked 'How do you view healthy people? How do you view people that understand the world?" and other questions, and tried to rationalize it between the Maslow Hierarchy. Found the data to be beyond self-actualization, a group feature simply not based on the individual personal needs.


### Graves' Inspiration

Graves detected that patterns surface even when people change from `what to what`. Detected different world-views around `express self` and `sacrifice self`.  Beck calls `express-self` and `sacrifice-self` a `TECHNOLOGY`. Beck says that Graves 'detected' or 'uncovered' these basic systems that already existed. 


### Graves' Test Methodology

Graves designed an instrument (takistoscopic?) that measures speed of recognition of symbols. Graves then designed symbols to reflect a specific world view.  He would reveal those words at different speeds on a monitor until the person saw the words and pushed the button.  He would then reveal the speed by which they viewed those words. The basis of the research is that it is revealing the priority of these systems for the testee.

Graves also did case studies and did the questionnaries for thousands of people.


### Graves' Big Idea

Rather than figure out 'what is the next psychological system, political system, or cutting edge view of management, he was looking for the deeper dynamic that produces those systems, the underlying `master trend maker` that produces trends. At what point does a new theory emerge and does it totally replace the old theories, or does it 'transcend and include' in the language of Ken Wilbur(sp?)?

Beck claims that Graves says that "there is no final state" and that "each system transcends AND includes the previous system", no utopian achievement or magic omega point. 

> Humans are simply the kind of organism with an immense, amazing capacity to recalibrate their worlds.

> What is it that causes the change?  Why do some people, companies, countries, organizations change and others don't? Can we figure out the master code to this process? Can we, while trying to figure out this master code, identify for the first time the equations that cause a change in the codes and why new codes appear? Why is the process different for different human groupings along a psychological trajectory.


### Twenty years beyond Clare Graves' Death in 1986

We should be ready to potentially begin to suggest that people ought to pay attention to this particular concept: "The Emergent Cyclical Double-Helix Model of Adult Biopsychosocial Systems." That's why we call it Spiral Dynamics, it's much easier to think in those terms.


### An Audio Clip of Clare Graves is Played

This shifts between summary and quotation.

Nature and Management of value systems is basically correct but a somewhat misleading perception of what Graves work is all about. There are, in the literature, publications of Graves on Values and on Management. They are derivative of a much larger area of interest. The studies are of the evolution in time and space of the adult human psychosocial systems. To comprehend what I have said about values, one must understand the totality of the work on which the work on values has developed, namely adult human psychosocial systems.

> What has been published by me is not completed work and was not completed at time of publishing. It is a preliminary effort. Errors have been made, some larger, some smaller. Errors were made. I would not say today some of the things I said in earlier publications. During early publication, some sketches etc. have been attractive to others. Some have been stimulated to research within those preliminary conceptions. I must state that the very acceptance, use of, and call for more of my ideas, that I was early of the mind to scatter has caused me to delay until I could find that in my own mind the thinking was basically conceived. I had to wait until the bugs were worked out, lest further publication compound the problems I was facing as I examined and reexamined my data. Tonight I am ready, and shall present for the first time.

Many "answers" to psychological development are described by Graves.


### Beck Pumps Up Graves

Beck spends some time pointing out the good characteristics of Graves, and makes him out to be a really well meaning and professional sounding guy. He points out that Graves feels that the data made him come to the conclusions that he did. Graves got sick and 'it was not healthy for him to express his ideas in written word'.

People laughed at the name of his theory a lot. Beck breaks down the components of the title.

This is chapter 1 at 45 minutes, and it's really not very precise.

- Emergent - Socieities emerge and people emerge in an evolutionary sense
- Cyclical - 
- Spiral - Two systems - `i/me/mine` and `we/us/our` causes a pendulum swing in society as the focus shifts (too much of one drives the other to prominence)
- Double-Helix - He describes both helices but it is a very jumbled definition
- Adult - Graves studied adults
- BioPsychoSocial - There are chemical underpinnings to psychology. Chemical assays and alloys or something, it's really a jumble. Oxytocin example. Beck claims that Graves identified the chemical and neurological structures of the first 5 systems he was able to isolate.

Value systems, called `MEMEs` in SESSION 2 have the ability "to jump, to morph, to recalibrate, to do a quantum leap".

It doesn't matter if you think things are contained in metaphysical systems or just in physical matter, either way the system works.

So, he adds to the word BIO, PSYCHO.  BIOPSYCHO.

What about SOCIAL? Oh well.


### Beck Rambles about Psycho-Social Systems

He talks about old psychosocial systems and equality.  He says the idea of steps of development are anathema because of white male european dominance and imperialism that has produced many of our problems. And that human development has trouble accepting a hierarchy of human development. Beck says that Graves uses a hierarchy but not of dominance or "better people" but the "complexity to handle problems".  Life has created greater complexity and survival has depended on the activation of that complexity at the same level or a level above.


### Spiral Dynamics is for Applied Purposes

Beck claims it is about deeper value structures, "fractals that organize" beneath the surface, that inhabit the core of where decisions are being made. The goal is to shape things at that level.

> The Graves Theory provides a specific strategy for doing this, not a 'theoretical concept with no application', it is just the opposite. Beck says they have been doing work for 30 years in applications, field studies, 'where the rubber hits the road.'  Stuff that works. This stuff is for handling some of the issues of stuff around us, not for idle conversation. Beck claims it takes 2-3 years to get your mind around it.

- Beck claims apartheid was not about race
- Beck claims that Islamic threat is not about religion

> I make no guarantee that at the end you will know what I am about at the end of these sessions. Maybe 6 months, one year, two years, maybe never.  I am not asking you to decide based on the evidence if this is true. I am asking you to determine if this is useable.  If you are interested in academic research and applications, I would be more than happy to share that with you.


## Session 2: The Codes By Which We Live

Let's discuss priorities for living / world views / `basic value systems`. We will look at *8 primary value systems*.

The terms `deep codes`, `memetics`, `value systems`, `world view`, are all synonomys and interchangeable in these six sessions.

Let's also use the word `memetics` and `meme` from Richard Dawkins' 'The Selfish Gene'

> Dawkins said he cannot account for culture genetically and coined `meme` to represent a `a unit of cultural information that propagates itself across the ecologies of mind and produces what we call *our belief systems*.

We are simply looking at how and why people value what the do. We are looking at how they think, not what they think.

What happens to people and organizations as they age and change or age and atrophy?  What happens during conflicts, the deepest areas of difference and how to create solutions that respect and honor those deep codes.

> Colors have been controversial. They were first used in South Africa to replace skin color pigmentation categories with a new language of difference that could transcend those categories. We wanted to break the stranglehold of Apartheid by first doing it within the symbolic systems. So I could talk to President Mandel about a Blue system and a Yellow system. We can use letter pairs, as did Graves, A-N, B-O, etc. Or we can use the language of levels: first, second, third, fourth level. In this presentation you will find it very useful to use colors. These colors have no particular symbolic meaning, they are arbitrary choices we decided to use to make communication much easier. Colors is a shorthand and becomes very convenient

The purpose is to find a basic value structure / worldview with the idea that the structure cascades through individuals, organizations, societies, leaves their imprint on culture and art. As the meme replicates itself as does a gene, it touches every aspect of our life experience. That's why being able to detect the code gives us a real advantage in managing complex systems and very threatening problems.

We want to move back in time and see when these systems first appeared, and societies that are developing from a less- to a more-complex state, and in a child's development.  As we track them through history we should see them even today. When we emerged for the first time, it was revolutionary and had a pure manifestation. Now that more complex systems are already developed the systems growing more complex for the first time are being influenced by existing complex systems.  This began once we crossed the rubicon from animals to thinking humans.


#### First Level System - Beige System - Survival Level System

Life conditions: no grocery stores, no medicine, a clan-type existence that just had to deal with the pattern of living. The primary goal was to meet the periodic, physiological needs of the species: food, water, sex, primitive music, adaptive intelligences. It would be a serious mistake to think of this as primitive.  This mind-brain may have had access to sensory systems we have lost, for example sensing a tiger in the bush, 'it was just amazing what they knew and when they knew it, shifts in a weather pattern, memories of where they buried ostrich eggs with their water supply'.

In a tragedy or crisis we will see people who regressed into a nearly helpless, temporary beige condition for example when working with a FEMA crisis they must detect people who regressed and need help to do the very ordinary skills of: booking reservations, meeting people, handling insurance claims. We could lock people into a beige type existence by providing care for too long and not returning them to their enviornment. Beck fears we can create very unhealthy systems where people get stuck in beige to hit organizational quotas.  Learned helplessness.  He says this raises ethical questions about who gets access to which medical care and how long we keep people alive who survive in a beige system.


### Second Level System - Purple System - Animistic Tribalistic One-For-All All-For-One

> The cow died. The moon was full. The cow died because the moon was full. What do you think happened the next time the moon was full?

Beck claims some Native American Tribes exist and/or existed in this system and used that as reasoning for naming their children after Elk or Eagles.  I don't really know, can any collection of tribe stories be said to represent what the individuals truly believed?

Desmond Tutu - Ubuntu - Mutual Recipricity. I find food and share with you today because tomorrow you find food and share with me. Beck says that sports teams and coaches still fall back to this system, wearing lucky hats and lucky ties before the game.

Another example: "something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue"

> I am going to keep making the point that these aren't types of people, these are systems in people, and even the way we adjust today to our existence problems often requires a full complement of all these systems that like christmas tree lights can brighten and dim.


### Third Level System - Red System - The Egocentric System


Youth who don't remember the experience of parents and grandparents, who don't remember the needs of their parents and grandparents, there comes a point when the *individual spirit wants to break free* - but breaking free of the voices of the ancestors, it takes a lot of macho, risk, self-awareness, and the other dynamics that cause to break away from the heavy purpose system on the part of the *elites* who like to break out on their own and would draw with them others from the tribe who want to break free from the oppression of the heavy use of ritual to keep them trapped. Beck claims we see this in the terrible twos as well, in a first awareness of the raw, egocentric self-discovery.

> I want it all, I want it now.  I want to be free.

A natural step in child rearing. The third level system is important in child rearing and societies who are in the stage of being detribalized. People with no sense of other people, who become wild, guiltless, virtually very shameless.  Beck says he watched as Zulu youth are frustrated with such ritual because they had been to the bright lights (the city). The breakaway from Apartheid was about breaking away from the tyranny of elders, a raw, revolutionary phase.

> The egosystem is neither good or bad. All have positive and negative aspects. Lets just say that the raw energy of red is essentially to producing humans who can take major risks and do major tasks like going to the moon. If we stifle this raw energy, we do ourselves a disservice, but if we look at the prison system, this red system without accountability inhabits a *completely different world*. In it's healthy version it is fun, risk taking. Musicians, race car drivers, linebackers, other expressions in power. "Women who are asserting themselves outside of the type, file, and smile mentality and beginning to assert themselves."

- Egocentric, predatory, "I want it all, I want it now", lack of guilt, insistence that the promethean value system can assert itself, often moves into the dominant position (either for good or ill).

- Redness requires heavy management, even ventilation. Everyone has it. Red does not have the guilt necessary of more complex systems but sometimes access the "weaponry" of more complex value systems... it's part of being human

Beck says third-world areas are red/purple.


### Fourth Level System - Blue System -

Red system grows older and gets scared.  We, us, our. Line up and go to college for 4 years before worrying about getting a motor car.

Transcendency, meaning, and purpose. Part of something larger and permanent, willing to conform my life, and give up my quest for pleasure and gratification and live for something more permanent.

A growing sense of purpose behind a religious or nationalistic system.

Sacrifice now to obtain later. Die for a cause, prepare for retirement, work for a principle.

Law, justice, fairness begin to appear. Without it, anarchy and greed takeover. When that occurs the more complex systems are arrested and cannot develop.

The Dutch system has issues where the "Dutch Blue" is in conflict with the "Islamic Blue". One blue-ism against another, both impacted by this worldview.

> Navigating through this blue zone is very difficult. Singapore has probably done the very best. They have 5 hot ethnic cores existing in purple and red. Singapore has 2 year mandatory national service for males, authority. It is a control mechanism to prevent the cores from exploding. Today it is moving into the orange system, keeping the blue system in place.

A society, family, a sports team, continues to exercise or resonate its purple, red, blue systems - keeping all in their healthy condition. If that doesn't happen, the more complex systems will be arrested, atrophy, one will become very primitive and very toxic versions of it.

If we erode the system we lose charity, fairness, law and order.


### Fifth Level System - Orange System - 

Enlightenment. We aren't content with divine state control. We are not content with theocratic explanations for the plague.

Secular, pragmatic attempt to control the secrets of the universe.

Assertion of the individual in the new expression of the individual. Strategic, Manipulative, materialistic, autonomous self, protestant revolution, age of science, breakthroughs of science, cause and effect beyond the purple version of the moon and the cloud.

If each individual works on their own, it can raise all boats.

> Thank you Adam Smith...

The ability to stand tall as humans and determine our own destiny.

Heavy risk takers, explorers. "The Creative Orange Mind".  The United States is really known for the Orange System.

The first chapter of Genesis was redefined in terms of stewardship over the planet, other interpretations of religious information through the orange system. The idea of coloring the bible by these color systems.

Technology to produce the good life here and now, but not necessarily to let go of the good life "there and then" - the pie in the sky, heaven. Often Beck finds very strong cool color system, purple, blue, green, and warm color system, red, orange, yellow. The protestant work ethic is a combination of a heavy blue, almost predestination system of religion, along with a heavy orange, success in business. Same with the Dutch travelling to Cape Town.

Today, orange is the dominant system on the planet. Success and profit drive. Recognizes that abundance meets peoples basic needs. Rather than worrying about lions, tigers, bears, worry about competition and taxation. High aspirations, positive outlook on life, a can-do philosophy.

The core of orange is "changeability".

Now Beck says "orange has landed people on the moon". I guess he considers red to integrate with orange.

If all we have is orange, if the whole world is a casino, where those who are lucky, skillful, or inherit wealth. If they have little concern for the earth, then we can see what damage it can bring. We have to recognize when it becomes unhealthy.

We must celebrate the healthy version of each meme code and recognize when it becomes unhealthy.  When a meme's manifestation interferes with another meme's right to be, that is not good for the human species. When a blue malignancy takes over the entire world with a priest is in charge, that would not be good.  When orange technocrats take over, driven only by bottom lines, that would not be good for the species.


### Sixth Level System - Green System - 

Humanistic, Egalitarian, Earthy, an attempt to rediscover our basic human-ness. Rejecting the materialism in orange and the dogma in blue.

A major wave of green, the attitude of the war in vietnam, rampant classism and racism. An attempt to rid ourselves with artificial and become authentic.

Our affluence produced the first expressions of green. You only find the emergence of green in the aftermath of orange success. The highest levels of green are found in scandanavian countries. You find pockets of green in American societies. Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Santa Barbara, Boulder. 

Found in habitats these forms (memes) can multiply and begin to complexify.

> It's about the memes! It's not about the categories it's not about the beliefs, it's about these belief systems (memetics, basic values).



### Beck says Graves Discovered These Systems

But they existed all along, we just can't see them except from a "Green System" vantage.


### Beck would like to articulate "what's next?"

Should we all be levitating where we find peace and our world is punctuated by the sound of gongs? Is that a form of escapism?

Certainly there is richness, humanness, calming, tranquility. All necessary.

We've convinced ourselves we discovered utopia around the corner. 

We fail to recognize there are billions of people where the next 24 hours matters.  Millions of people escaping the predator, trapped in red zones. People moving into blue zones, searching for a religious experience or personalized god on a throne somewhere.

If we think god has died, it's because our own value systems are such that we move into more complex thinking,  ability to think in terms of cosmos, of deeper senses of spirituality. Those moving into a blue system will embrace a concrete type, in most cases father-dominant theocracy.

Those of us moving into the orange zone want to acquire enough to be comfortable in this world and are not so interested in a zone of personal theology.

If we are not careful, through our nirvana, that we think we can expose everyone to our Green System, they simply aren't ready yet. Including things like full equal human rights for everyone. Maybe the highest level of caring is to not impose on people, who are not capable, to embrace what we truly believe is critical.

> At each stage of human existence, the adult is off on his quest for his holy grail, the way of live by which he seeks to exist. On his first level, autonomic physiological satisfaction. Second level is a method of living. Third level is search for heroic and power. Fourth is ultimate peace. Fifth is material pleasure in orange.  Affectionate relations in green.  But then, a search for respect of self (in session 3, Beck calls this yellow). A search for peace in an incomprehensible world (turqoise). When you find that you will not find that peace, ninth level quest (coral). As he sets off on each quest, he believes he will find the answer to his existence. Much to his surprise and dismay, he finds that the solution to existence is not the solution he has come to find. Every stage he reaches leaves him disconcerted and perplexed. As he solves one set of human problems, he finds a new set in his place. The quest he finds is never-ending.


## Session 3: The Leap into Second Tier

The first six layers of complexity were described in section 2.

Graves found the seventh level system to NOT be a continuation of the first six. He found, rather, some kind of "quantum jump".

> Trent: I can find some peace with this 'quantized' jump, like an electron in a different orbital or something.

Graves call the "first set of systems" the `Existence Systems`. As we are ready to exit our animalistic nature and poised to enter a whole different conceptual world.

> "poised for a momentus leap" - as in the title of "The Futurist"

> It's one thing if we wipe each other out with machine guns or bow and arrows. It's another thing if we create a nuclear winter or release microbes that attack our genetic material.

Then he calls the `Existence Systems` the `fs green` system for some reason. I guess that means "first set green".

**There is more good talk at the beginning of this chapter that should be summarized.**


### Beck Rambles about Conflicting Systems

Essentially all systems demand attention and it causes other systems to be diminished or out of balance. It lasts a long time.


### Getting Rid of Systems?

> We can't get rid of the other systems quite simply because there are billions of people passing through those systems. If we get rid of them we stymie billions of people with nowhere to go.

Trent: I thought he said these systems exist in everyone to some degree, so isn't this statement really off base?


### What is the point of this system of thought?

> I'm not constructing a heavy Machiavellian attempt to change people. I am in the business of trying to create structures, habitats, dams, locks, that will naturally produce the environments for the self-organizing non-linear jumps to occur in humans.

> What we have are sinkholes, backwaters, cesspools full of all kinds of social poison. How do we drain the swamp? How do we as humans, not a cultural or national group, get our minds around the problem of the emergence of 6 billion people on a very delicate, fragile planet. This is our neverending quest today and is what we are searching for.

> At each of these major ratchets (colors/systems) that graves talks about, it takes a crisis to awaken our capabilities. Since this is a biopsychosocial theory, it takes a crisis to actually think the kind of thinking modalities that can solve it. Graves used to call these degrees of activation of the nervous system. Beck goes on to say that these are like upgrades of DOS, the operating system. Why... we already have like 4 synonyms.

### Some more rambling

> Warm colors create gaps between people, predator-prey, exploiter-exploitee.  Cool colors close the gaps. Green redistributes wealth to ensure more people are winners.  As people go back and forth they go back and forth. 


### Yellow - An Acceptance of Verticality; Steps, Stages, Waves

Beck decides not to form complete sentences for awhile.

Two Tracks to something or other:
    - `orange -> green -> yellow`
    - `green -> yellow -> turqoise`

The below is just completely unacceptable. There is no reason to continue this book.

> As we ponder the question - "How we find the models of thinking and the approach to problem resolution of greater complexity than the kinds of problems that we've created for ourselves. That's our challenge. If one is interested to really understand the seventh level system, the first and the second tier, the integrative, the natural, the authentic, a sense of flexible flow, then one simply has to look at the life conditions of, that is to say what functions need to be performed given those life conditions. The characteristic and texture of each of the systems is in large part but not totally the result of what those functions need to be. If we have life conditions A, then the kinds of mind-brains and social forms and clans, and in, they're called, are necessary for conditions A. If on the other hand, we have problems B which we have identified earlier, then this will begin to dictate the contours and shape of system O, thus the appearance of the tribal bonding order. If once again we have problem C, a jungle type mentality, then the predation and the strength and the power contained within the P system are necessary to handle the dragons because in the CP Red world, there are always dragons either real or imaginary. That's why the system tends to be very sensitive, often very paranoid, quick to insult, fast trigger. Because it believes it lives in that kind of very dangerous world where if it doesn't act first and defend self, it will be overwhelmed. And, when we have problems D, the chaos ultimately caused by mature red empire systems and the hedonism and the viciousness, and the coldbloodedness and the constant gas between the haves and the have-nots with the imperialistic systems then that is what gave rise to system D, so system D has guild-based obedience, a sense of obligation and conformity, a clear set of rules and regulations, what sets out for a person how to receive a just reward. That is to say, a retirement, a hope of heaven, whatever that happens to be. Sacrifice now to obtain later. And likewise, conditions E, a very secular world where all the energy is let loose for the successful ones and the reality that one cannot find the causes of the plagues in the bible and one must learn the secrets of the universe which gave rise to System R. And obviously the same trend follows with problem F, the sixth level set of problems created by the successes and the failures of the earlier systems with the intent to once again restore humanness in the age of the machine and the depersonalization and the loss of the sense of the person that characterizes the fifth level orange system. So, S will be determined by F. If we follow that same sequence then we ask, as we have a moment ago, describe some of the life conditions that all of us confront at problems G, unlike any we have had before, because we have all these systems I have just named at full blast, each demanding their place in the sun and the resulting chaos then cannot be resolved by any of the first six systems. So system T, or seventh level, or yellow in our color code, will have to emerge in such a way it can address those particular systems. 
> Now some people often confuse the work of Clare W Graves with that of Abraham Maslow who in his self-actualization seems to be stating some of the aspects of this system and I think that is probably the case, but when I used to talk with Clare about that we agreed that the Maslow pyramid with self-actualization at the top in terms of the pinnacle, with each set of needs being met and then releasing energy for the next to be met, Graves really believed that one could put that particular pyramid within each of the memetic fields, so that Billy Graham would be self-actualized at the fourth level of human existence. Donald Trump would be self-actualized at the fifth level set of life conditions. Former President Jimmy Carter would be self-actualized at the sixth level of human existence. Because all self-actualization means is using more of the brain that's there, but remember a key Gravesian concept that today is getting massive support of scientific studies of the mind brain is that each of these systems represents a different configured mind-brain. That is to say that certain systems in the brain that process are hooked up in a different mesh-work, which is a term that is used by brain scientists. That's why often change that we are trying to explain is not a willy nilly kind of superficial change of choice in toothpaste. The kind of change that we will be talking about later, change variation 7, means a total recalibration, a total almost reengineering, with different brain systems and processes and chemistry all meshed together in a new gestalt. So that we are literally suggesting that this major shift involves recovery, regeneration, and then renewal. And that the idea here is that we have to build the new processing systems that will have the codes of complexity to manage the world that we have both caused and inherited.
