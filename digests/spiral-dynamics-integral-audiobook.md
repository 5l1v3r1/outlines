## Session 1: The Dance of the Double Helix / How Humans Emerge

There are six independent sections that stand on their own but are woven together into a tapestry. Beck is encouraging the reader to listen to the examples and war stories and think within the system.


### Introduction

Beck was reading an article, 'Humans Prepare for a Momentus Leap' in 'The Futurist' - by Clare W. Graves

Here is [the article](http://www.clarewgraves.com/articles_content/1974_Futurist/1974_Futurist.html).

Beck's Summary: 

> The kinds of patterns we detect in our society are not doom and gloom, but an essential stage in human history where we set up the conditions for a major leap into a whole different way of seeing the world.

They became good friends. Beck dedicated his life to making more of Graves' ideas accessible.

During these sessions, Beck will:

> talk about the nature of this powerful conceptual system that from our experiences, in some of the most difficult places on the planet, it may very well hold the key to unlocking many of the conflicts that we find today to be very lethal.

In South Africa, Beck says he used this model "to replace the ethnic-racial categories in Apartheid to make it possible Nelson Mandela for others to move out of the threat of civil war." and now wants to use it on fundamentalist Islamic terrorist mindset in Dutch society and then take it elsewhere. Also redesigning organizations to connect to marketplace and for employees in ways that fit who they are. In sports, the NFL, and global. Also designed schools. "It is beginning to have a universal application." Beck loosely calls it `a theory of everything`, not THE theory of everything.


### Session 1 Overview

We will visit the work of Graves: research, discovery, conceptual system, allay any fears that this is the latest psycho-babble.


### Session 2 Overview

We will take you a trip up the existential staircase, along the psychological map, how each of the numatic codes appeared, why they did, and how they express themselves.  The codes are like musical notes, but form musical chords because they are systems within us, not types of us. 

This session covers the FIRST TIER which is the FIRST SIX SYSTEMS.


### Session 3 Overview

We will move into the `SECOND TIER`, the next set of SIX SYSTEMS and looking at issues today in terms of their complexities and how we can work as individuals, leaders of organizations, communities, and members of the human race. How we can find fresh approaches to the very complex issues that confront us.


### Session 4 Overview

A specific application of this knowledge in terms of change itself.  Change from what, to what.  Look at the EIGHT DIMENSIONS OF CHANGE. Look at particular processes we go through when we leap to a new PLATFORM or PARADIGM. With some precision look at the nature of change in ourselves, life choices, our family relationships, the nature of our communities, and the future of our planet. Look at the whole matter of ORGANIZATIONS.

 
### Session 5 Overview

Begin to look at organizations. Begin to answer the question "How should who manage whom to do what?" or "How should who teach whom to do what?" Moving the focus from the individual trajectory to kinds and domains of human groups. A major part of the approach is how to view, transform, and refresh organizations.


### Session 6 Overview

Take a broad look at 6 billion people and ask "How can we stitch together our wounded world?"


### Anecdotes

Beck talks about Graves feeling unauthentic because he could not address which psychological theories are "useful". Instead of giving up teaching, Graves started a study of thousands of people.  He asked 'How do you view healthy people? How do you view people that understand the world?" and other questions, and tried to rationalize it between the Maslow Hierarchy. Found the data to be beyond self-actualization, a group feature simply not based on the individual personal needs.


### Graves' Inspiration

Graves detected that patterns surface even when people change from `what to what`. Detected different world-views around `express self` and `sacrifice self`.  Beck calls `express-self` and `sacrifice-self` a `TECHNOLOGY`. Beck says that Graves 'detected' or 'uncovered' these basic systems that already existed. 


### Graves' Test Methodology

Graves designed an instrument (takistoscopic?) that measures speed of recognition of symbols. Graves then designed symbols to reflect a specific world view.  He would reveal those words at different speeds on a monitor until the person saw the words and pushed the button.  He would then reveal the speed by which they viewed those words. The basis of the research is that it is revealing the priority of these systems for the testee.

Graves also did case studies and did the questionnaries for thousands of people.


### Graves' Big Idea

Rather than figure out 'what is the next psychological system, political system, or cutting edge view of management, he was looking for the deeper dynamic that produces those systems, the underlying `master trend maker` that produces trends. At what point does a new theory emerge and does it totally replace the old theories, or does it 'transcend and include' in the language of Ken Wilbur(sp?)?

Beck claims that Graves says that "there is no final state" and that "each system transcends AND includes the previous system", no utopian achievement or magic omega point. 

> Humans are simply the kind of organism with an immense, amazing capacity to recalibrate their worlds.

> What is it that causes the change?  Why do some people, companies, countries, organizations change and others don't? Can we figure out the master code to this process? Can we, while trying to figure out this master code, identify for the first time the equations that cause a change in the codes and why new codes appear? Why is the process different for different human groupings along a psychological trajectory.


### Twenty years beyond Clare Graves' Death in 1986

We should be ready to potentially begin to suggest that people ought to pay attention to this particular concept: "The Emergent Cyclical Double-Helix Model of Adult Biopsychosocial Systems." That's why we call it Spiral Dynamics, it's much easier to think in those terms.


### An Audio Clip of Clare Graves is Played

This shifts between summary and quotation.

Nature and Management of value systems is basically correct but a somewhat misleading perception of what Graves work is all about. There are, in the literature, publications of Graves on Values and on Management. They are derivative of a much larger area of interest. The studies are of the evolution in time and space of the adult human psychosocial systems. To comprehend what I have said about values, one must understand the totality of the work on which the work on values has developed, namely adult human psychosocial systems.

> What has been published by me is not completed work and was not completed at time of publishing. It is a preliminary effort. Errors have been made, some larger, some smaller. Errors were made. I would not say today some of the things I said in earlier publications. During early publication, some sketches etc. have been attractive to others. Some have been stimulated to research within those preliminary conceptions. I must state that the very acceptance, use of, and call for more of my ideas, that I was early of the mind to scatter has caused me to delay until I could find that in my own mind the thinking was basically conceived. I had to wait until the bugs were worked out, lest further publication compound the problems I was facing as I examined and reexamined my data. Tonight I am ready, and shall present for the first time.

Many "answers" to psychological development are described by Graves.


### Beck Pumps Up Graves

Beck spends some time pointing out the good characteristics of Graves, and makes him out to be a really well meaning and professional sounding guy. He points out that Graves feels that the data made him come to the conclusions that he did. Graves got sick and 'it was not healthy for him to express his ideas in written word'.

People laughed at the name of his theory a lot. Beck breaks down the components of the title.

This is chapter 1 at 45 minutes, and it's really not very precise.

- Emergent - Socieities emerge and people emerge in an evolutionary sense
- Cyclical - 
- Spiral - Two systems - `i/me/mine` and `we/us/our` causes a pendulum swing in society as the focus shifts (too much of one drives the other to prominence)
- Double-Helix - He describes both helices but it is a very jumbled definition
- Adult - Graves studied adults
- BioPsychoSocial - There are chemical underpinnings to psychology. Chemical assays and alloys or something, it's really a jumble. Oxytocin example. Beck claims that Graves identified the chemical and neurological structures of the first 5 systems he was able to isolate.

Value systems, called `MEMEs` in SESSION 2 have the ability "to jump, to morph, to recalibrate, to do a quantum leap".

It doesn't matter if you think things are contained in metaphysical systems or just in physical matter, either way the system works.

So, he adds to the word BIO, PSYCHO.  BIOPSYCHO.

What about SOCIAL? Oh well.


### Beck Rambles about Psycho-Social Systems

He talks about old psychosocial systems and equality.  He says the idea of steps of development are anathema because of white male european dominance and imperialism that has produced many of our problems. And that human development has trouble accepting a hierarchy of human development. Beck says that Graves uses a hierarchy but not of dominance or "better people" but the "complexity to handle problems".  Life has created greater complexity and survival has depended on the activation of that complexity at the same level or a level above.


### Spiral Dynamics is for Applied Purposes

Beck claims it is about deeper value structures, "fractals that organize" beneath the surface, that inhabit the core of where decisions are being made. The goal is to shape things at that level.

> The Graves Theory provides a specific strategy for doing this, not a 'theoretical concept with no application', it is just the opposite. Beck says they have been doing work for 30 years in applications, field studies, 'where the rubber hits the road.'  Stuff that works. This stuff is for handling some of the issues of stuff around us, not for idle conversation. Beck claims it takes 2-3 years to get your mind around it.

- Beck claims apartheid was not about race
- Beck claims that Islamic threat is not about religion

> I make no guarantee that at the end you will know what I am about at the end of these sessions. Maybe 6 months, one year, two years, maybe never.  I am not asking you to decide based on the evidence if this is true. I am asking you to determine if this is useable.  If you are interested in academic research and applications, I would be more than happy to share that with you.


## Session 2: The Codes By Which We Live

Let's discuss priorities for living / world views / `basic value systems`. We will look at *8 primary value systems*.

The terms `deep codes`, `memetics`, `value systems`, `world view`, are all synonomys and interchangeable in these six sessions.

Let's also use the word `memetics` and `meme` from Richard Dawkins' 'The Selfish Gene'

> Dawkins said he cannot account for culture genetically and coined `meme` to represent a `a unit of cultural information that propagates itself across the ecologies of mind and produces what we call *our belief systems*.

We are simply looking at how and why people value what the do. We are looking at how they think, not what they think.

What happens to people and organizations as they age and change or age and atrophy?  What happens during conflicts, the deepest areas of difference and how to create solutions that respect and honor those deep codes.

> Colors have been controversial. They were first used in South Africa to replace skin color pigmentation categories with a new language of difference that could transcend those categories. We wanted to break the stranglehold of Apartheid by first doing it within the symbolic systems. So I could talk to President Mandel about a Blue system and a Yellow system. We can use letter pairs, as did Graves, A-N, B-O, etc. Or we can use the language of levels: first, second, third, fourth level. In this presentation you will find it very useful to use colors. These colors have no particular symbolic meaning, they are arbitrary choices we decided to use to make communication much easier. Colors is a shorthand and becomes very convenient

The purpose is to find a basic value structure / worldview with the idea that the structure cascades through individuals, organizations, societies, leaves their imprint on culture and art. As the meme replicates itself as does a gene, it touches every aspect of our life experience. That's why being able to detect the code gives us a real advantage in managing complex systems and very threatening problems.

We want to move back in time and see when these systems first appeared, and societies that are developing from a less- to a more-complex state, and in a child's development.  As we track them through history we should see them even today. When we emerged for the first time, it was revolutionary and had a pure manifestation. Now that more complex systems are already developed the systems growing more complex for the first time are being influenced by existing complex systems.  This began once we crossed the rubicon from animals to thinking humans.


### First Level System - Beige System - Survival Level System

Life conditions: no grocery stores, no medicine, a clan-type existence that just had to deal with the pattern of living. The primary goal was to meet the periodic, physiological needs of the species: food, water, sex, primitive music, adaptive intelligences. It would be a serious mistake to think of this as primitive.  This mind-brain may have had access to sensory systems we have lost, for example sensing a tiger in the bush, 'it was just amazing what they knew and when they knew it, shifts in a weather pattern, memories of where they buried ostrich eggs with their water supply'.
