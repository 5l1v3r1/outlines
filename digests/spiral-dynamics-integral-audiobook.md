## Session 1: The Dance of the Double Helix / How Humans Emerge

There are six independent sections that stand on their own but are woven together into a tapestry. Beck is encouraging the reader to listen to the examples and war stories and think within the system.


### Introduction

Beck was reading an article, 'Humans Prepare for a Momentus Leap' in 'The Futurist' - by Clare W. Graves

Here is [the article](http://www.clarewgraves.com/articles_content/1974_Futurist/1974_Futurist.html).

Beck's Summary: 

> The kinds of patterns we detect in our society are not doom and gloom, but an essential stage in human history where we set up the conditions for a major leap into a whole different way of seeing the world.

They became good friends. Beck dedicated his life to making more of Graves' ideas accessible.

During these sessions, Beck will:

> talk about the nature of this powerful conceptual system that from our experiences, in some of the most difficult places on the planet, it may very well hold the key to unlocking many of the conflicts that we find today to be very lethal.

In South Africa, Beck says he used this model "to replace the ethnic-racial categories in Apartheid to make it possible Nelson Mandela for others to move out of the threat of civil war." and now wants to use it on fundamentalist Islamic terrorist mindset in Dutch society and then take it elsewhere. Also redesigning organizations to connect to marketplace and for employees in ways that fit who they are. In sports, the NFL, and global. Also designed schools. "It is beginning to have a universal application." Beck loosely calls it `a theory of everything`, not THE theory of everything.


### Session 1 Overview

We will visit the work of Graves: research, discovery, conceptual system, allay any fears that this is the latest psycho-babble.


### Session 2 Overview

We will take you a trip up the existential staircase, along the psychological map, how each of the numatic codes appeared, why they did, and how they express themselves.  The codes are like musical notes, but form musical chords because they are systems within us, not types of us. 

This session covers the FIRST TIER which is the FIRST SIX SYSTEMS.


### Session 3 Overview

We will move into the `SECOND TIER`, the next set of SIX SYSTEMS and looking at issues today in terms of their complexities and how we can work as individuals, leaders of organizations, communities, and members of the human race. How we can find fresh approaches to the very complex issues that confront us.


### Session 4 Overview

A specific application of this knowledge in terms of change itself.  Change from what, to what.  Look at the EIGHT DIMENSIONS OF CHANGE. Look at particular processes we go through when we leap to a new PLATFORM or PARADIGM. With some precision look at the nature of change in ourselves, life choices, our family relationships, the nature of our communities, and the future of our planet. Look at the whole matter of ORGANIZATIONS.

 
### Session 5 Overview

Begin to look at organizations. Begin to answer the question "How should who manage whom to do what?" or "How should who teach whom to do what?" Moving the focus from the individual trajectory to kinds and domains of human groups. A major part of the approach is how to view, transform, and refresh organizations.


### Session 6 Overview

Take a broad look at 6 billion people and ask "How can we stitch together our wounded world?"


### Anecdotes

Beck talks about Graves feeling unauthentic because he could not address which psychological theories are "useful". Instead of giving up teaching, Graves started a study of thousands of people.  He asked 'How do you view healthy people? How do you view people that understand the world?" and other questions, and tried to rationalize it between the Maslow Hierarchy. Found the data to be beyond self-actualization, a group feature simply not based on the individual personal needs.


### Graves' Inspiration

Graves detected that patterns surface even when people change from `what to what`. Detected different world-views around `express self` and `sacrifice self`.  Beck calls `express-self` and `sacrifice-self` a `TECHNOLOGY`. Beck says that Graves 'detected' or 'uncovered' these basic systems that already existed. 


### Graves' Test Methodology

Graves designed an instrument (takistoscopic?) that measures speed of recognition of symbols. Graves then designed symbols to reflect a specific world view.  He would reveal those words at different speeds on a monitor until the person saw the words and pushed the button.  He would then reveal the speed by which they viewed those words. The basis of the research is that it is revealing the priority of these systems for the testee.

Graves also did case studies and did the questionnaries for thousands of people.


### Graves' Big Idea

Rather than figure out 'what is the next psychological system, political system, or cutting edge view of management, he was looking for the deeper dynamic that produces those systems, the underlying `master trend maker` that produces trends. At what point does a new theory emerge and does it totally replace the old theories, or does it 'transcend and include' in the language of Ken Wilbur(sp?)?

Beck claims that Graves says that "there is no final state" and that "each system transcends AND includes the previous system", no utopian achievement or magic omega point. 

> Humans are simply the kind of organism with an immense, amazing capacity to recalibrate their worlds.

> What is it that causes the change?  Why do some people, companies, countries, organizations change and others don't? Can we figure out the master code to this process? Can we, while trying to figure out this master code, identify for the first time the equations that cause a change in the codes and why new codes appear? Why is the process different for different human groupings along a psychological trajectory.
