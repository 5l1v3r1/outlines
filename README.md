### Outlines

This project collects detailed notes as aggregate outlines.

Please send `pull requests` if you notice errors.

### Purpose

1. Store information in a way that can be easily referenced or updated.
2. Have a destination for information curated during deep projects, especially after they end.


### Locations

1. `praxes` - praxis/process oriented information
2. `reference` - primarly aggregated from another source
3. `monographs` - my original, observations from data and experiences
4. `events` - notes from speakers and events 
5. `summaries` - for longer works, if it is worth reading, it is worth taking notes on
6. `external` - copies of external outlines worth keeping handy
