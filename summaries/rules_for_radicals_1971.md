### To The Reader - Don't provide materials for direct action, especially to people you think you trust

In 2012-2017, the FBI has repeatedly radicalized left-wing organizations to cross strict legal barriers in perceived assistance of domestic terrorism.  

Here is a half baked guide [about what infiltrators will do](http://www.rooshv.com/how-the-fbi-infiltrates-movements-and-what-you-can-do-to-stop-them).

>Also in Texas, a left-wing group was infiltrated by an FBI informant who insisted that the group become violent in response to the Republican scourge. Once he convinced members to make Molotov cocktails, the FBI [stormed in and made arrests](http://web.archive.org/web/20170203130247/http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/brandon-darby-anarchist-fbi-terrorism).

>Lastly, the FBI infiltrated middle-aged peace activists and filed trumped-up charges of them providing “assistance” to terrorists. The bogus charges were eventually dropped.

The FBI has also [infiltrated Oil Pipeline Protestors](http://web.archive.org/web/20170202145036/https://shadowproof.com/2017/01/31/fbi-rule-book-reveals-loopholes-infiltrating-groups-protesting-pipelines/) using legal loopholes.


### Notes

Taken while reading the book.


#### Prologue

> "Few [radicals] survived the Joe McCarthy Holocaust of the 1950s and of those there were even fewer whose understanding and insights had developed beyond the dialectical materialism of orthodox Marxism. My fellow radicals who were supposed to pass on the torch of experience and insights to the new generation just were not there. As the young looked around at society around them, it was all, in their words, 'materialistic, decadent, bourgeois in its values, bankrupt, and violent.' Is it any wonder that they rejected us in toto."

- Reader note: [McCarthyism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism) is seen now as a reactionary backlash to issues as far ranging as `women's suffrage`, `child labor laws`, and `gay rights`, as well as a means for certain politicians to use fear to keep power. The FBI is also implicated heavily in performing illegal spying.  There are loophopes for domestic spying [used by the FBI today](http://web.archive.org/web/20170202180421/https://shadowproof.com/2017/01/31/fbi-rule-book-reveals-loopholes-infiltrating-groups-protesting-pipelines/). 

- Young people have seen 'activist democracies' turn into 'nihilistic bombing and murder' and there is no panacea for it as there was in the past, 'revolution in Russia and China has since become the same old stuff under a different name'.
- Young people are looking for a way of life that has some meaning or sense: religion, political philosophy, science, or ideologies.
- The small world of the past inspired trust, and the big world of today inspires confusion and incomprehensibility.
- *Generation Gap* - Older people think younger people haven't learned how the world is, younger people think the old people will never get with the changing times.
- Approaches to the chaotic world by the young:
    1. Panic and run - "copping out"
        - Hippies and Yuppies
        - Taking drugs
        - Trying communes
        - Anything to escape
    2. Sure-loser confrontations: "We tried and did our part"
        - Dying
        - Jail
        - Followed by panic and run, "copping out"
    3. Guilt and "not knowing where to turn to"
        - Suicide
        - Contempt
        - "take off for Algeria"
- There are no rules for revolution as there are for revelation.

> "Remember we are talking about revolution, not revelation; you can miss the target by shooting too high as well as too low.
