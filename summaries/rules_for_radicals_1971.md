### Notes

Taken while reading the book.


#### Prologue

- Young people have seen 'activist democracies' turn into 'nihilistic bombing and murder' and there is no panacea for it as there was in the past, 'revolution in Russia and China has since become the same old stuff under a different name'.
- Young people are looking for a way of life that has some meaning or sense: religion, political philosophy, science, or ideologies.
- The small world of the past inspired trust, and the big world of today inspires confusion and incomprehensibility.
- *Generation Gap* - Older people think younger people haven't learned how the world is, younger people think the old people will never get with the changing times.
- Approaches to the chaotic world by the young:
    1. Panic and run - "copping out"
        - Hippies and Yuppies
        - Taking drugs
        - Trying communes
        - Anything to escape
    2. Sure-loser confrontations: "We tried and did our part"
        - Dying
        - Jail
        - Followed by panic and run, "copping out"
    3. Guilt and "not knowing where to turn to"
        - Suicide
        - Contempt
        - "take off for Algeria"
- There are no rules for revolution as there are for revelation.
> "Remember we are talking about revolution, not revelation; you can miss the target by shooting too high as well as too low.
