## Maximum Heart Rate

WARNING: This heart rate is your absolute MAXIMUM and could cause damage. 

It may also be EVEN LOWER for you than the calculations, it's just an AVERAGE, so DON'T reach this heart rate.

> [But reaching your MAXIMUM HEART RATE—the greatest number of beats per minute your heart can possibly achieve during exercise—requires an all-out effort that is extremely uncomfortable and impossible to maintain; even the most highly trained athletes can only maintain this intensity for a few minutes at a time. In addition, exercising at or near your maximum heart rate has not been shown to have significant benefits. In fact, it can actually be risky because of the stress it puts on your heart.][1]


## Target Heart Rate

Your target heart rate (THR ZONE) is 70 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate.

IMPORTANT: There's no evidence that being at the high or low range of your Target Heart Rate is better... 

> [By knowing your TARGET HEART RATE you assure yourself that you optimize fitness improvement, calorie- and fat-burning, and you prevent overdoing it and not having fun during exercise.][1]

## How to improve at cardio

There is no reason to push your heart rate during non-competitive exercise.

Going above your target heart rate increases risk of damage.

If you want to push yourself then: **increase the TIME you are at your target heart rate.**


### Calculations

1. Max Heart Rate @ 34 Years: 220 - 34 = 186 BPM - WARNING  - DO NOT GET NEAR THIS HEART RATE
    - WARNING: This heart rate is your absolute MAXIMUM and could cause damage. 
    - It may also be EVEN LOWER for you, it's just an AVERAGE.

1. Target Heart rate is 70%-85% of Max Heart Rate: 186 * (70% to 85%) = 130 - 158 BPM
    - You want to spend your workout in this range... but how much time at each part of the range? I like to alternate every 5 min for 25 min.
    - I hit this something like 8 minutes into the workout? Measure what is a comfortable and natural ramp.

1. Minimum Exercise Heart Rate is 60% of Max Heart Rate: 186 * 60% = 112 bpm
	- I easily hit this and warm out quite comfortably to 120 BPM within a few minutes


### Timespan

This website says to stay at your TARGET HEART RATE, 130-158 for at least 15-20 mins and ideally 35-40 mins... but which one??
