# Learning HTML5 Native Game Dev


## Goals

1. Make some simple games in `html5`
2. Somehow translate the games to `mobile native (Android & iOS)`
3. Leverage existing javascript libraries for multiplayer, maybe even run a server/api for play between phone and browser users


## Notes

- `SVG Keyframe animations` may be sort of restricted to data visualization, not games.
- Game Engines tend to use `webgl` and fallback to `canvas`.

## Option: react-game-kit

Pitch from the dev:

- Use the same game code for web, iOS, android
- Use react
- Hot reload game logic
- Don't have to learn unity

### Recommendations

Jeffrey built [this](https://jeffreyatw.github.io/react-redux-platformer)  ([source](https://github.com/JeffreyATW/react-redux-platformer)).

> i made this once. this uses `matter.js` as well as `react-game-kit`, the status of which i’m unaware. seems straightforward enough, although it uses the DOM instead of canvas, which i’m iffy about - Jeffrey

> Formidable Labs does great stuff - Nick


## Option: pixi.js

2D Sprite Managment.

## Option: Unreal Engine 4

Does html5, maybe overkill.
