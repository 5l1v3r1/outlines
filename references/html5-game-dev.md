# Learning HTML5 Native Game Dev


## Goals

1. Make some simple games in html5
2. Somehow translate the games to mobile app native
3. Leverage existing javascript libraries for multiplayer, maybe even run a server/api for play between phone and browser


## Option: react-game-kit

- Use the same game code for web, iOS, android
- Use react
- Hot reload game logic
- Don't have to learn unity
