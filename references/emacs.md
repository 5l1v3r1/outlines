## Simpler Emacs

I intend to install a number of packages from spacemacs.



### Quickref

1. `M-x`: get a prompt

#### At the prompt

nb: `RET` is `return key`, the whitespace is for readability.

- `package-list-packages RET`: list packages
- `package-install RET`: get a package install prompt
    - `evil RET`: i did not find `evil-mode` in the packages, so installed `evil`

### Installing Packages

The emacs wiki has a [guide](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InstallingPackages).

### Installing use-package

An easier way to install packages? People like it. Seems heavy to me...

- [init.el example with use-package](http://cachestocaches.com/2015/8/getting-started-use-package/)
    - [code](https://github.com/CachesToCaches/getting_started_with_use_package/blob/master/init-use-package.el)

### Notes

1. M-<key>: You can press escape then the key instead of meta.


### Future

1. [Evil Plugins](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil#toc6)
    - lots of additional features


### Desired Spacemacs Packages

1. helm
2. evil-mode

    - this was pretty out of date but a good general guide
    - took lots of googling to find the right command for evil-mode stuff
