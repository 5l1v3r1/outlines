# A Plan to Learn Rust

I was planning on learning C but it's tough to get up to speed and people seem to have wildly varying practices. It would be better to learn low level things in a modern context with less baggage.


## The Plan

Go through the book (2nd edition) and check out the community maintained git repo.

Skip the examples for now because I've already run them once.

Learn about `rustup` and how to maintain your `rust` toolchain. Hopefully build an analogy to `python-virtualenv`.
