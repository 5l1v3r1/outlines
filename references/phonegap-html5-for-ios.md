## Use PhoneGap to build a html5 app to iOS

I read somewhere that phonegap CLI is easier once you downaload the ios and android SDKs.



1. Get an apple developer account - individual is faster
	1. [enroll](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/)
		- you have to pay $99 + tax (no tax if you have a ADUNS, TIN)
		- individual can do apple ID
		- company can use ADUNS number to get company apple id
		- other requirements listed at the link (above)
1. Get an apple iOS signing certificate
	1. lots to this, follow [phonegap instructions](http://docs.phonegap.com/phonegap-build/signing/ios/)
1. Build the app in phonegap
	- attach the github link, it will build
	- i have no idea what the app needs to build properly... lol
1. Download the `.ipa` file!
	- iPhone apps are `.ipa` files, cool.
1. Install `Apple Configurator 2` by Apple (in the app store)
	- This can be used to configure apple devices
	- Drag the `.ipa` file onto `Apple Configurator 2`
1. Open the app by pressing the new icon on your phone
